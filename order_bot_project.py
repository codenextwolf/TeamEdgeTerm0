	# You've just learned about variables, conditionals, functions, and user input. 
	# You've also created a basic calculator in a previous project.
	
	# Now imagine you are going out to eat.
	# Are you at a restaurant for a meal? Are you grabbing boba? Or are you just going to an ice cream parlor?
	# At the end of the meal, you get the bill. 

	# How do you think restaurants automate that math?

					# Let's try it!

# -------------------------------------------- 

# Scenario Parameters: 

	# When you eat out, you have the option to order one or multiple items.
	# What kind of items are available to order? There's usually a menu.
	# Allow your user to order a drink, meal, and dessert.

	# At the end of the order, the receipt comes and you have to calculate the total cost:
	# Don't forget the tax and tip!

# After this program finishes running, it should output a receipt with:
        #1. the items you ordered and their cost 
	#2. a total for your order before tax
	#3. a total for your order after tax
	#4. the amount of your tip 
	#5. the total including tax and tip

# -------------------------------------------- 

# Part 1:
# Let's start by displaying the menu. Include the food item name and it's cost. 

# Write a function that will display the menu:
# - Print each item available and it's cost. You should have at least 3 items available (a drink, meal, and dessert item). 

# --------------------------------------------






# -------------------------------------------- 

# Part 2:
# Let's take the order. What did the user order? What does it cost?

# Write a function that will take the order:
# - Prompt the user to enter a drink, dessert, and meal (Bonus: give them the option to not order an item)
# - Return the cost 

# Remember! Functions are meant to be reusable, so write a function that will work when called repeatedly!

# --------------------------------------------












# -------------------------------------------- 

# Part 3:
# Now that you have the costs of everything ordered, let's calculate the cost of each person's order(including tip and tax).

# Write a function that will calculate the cost of each person's order, including:
# - Cost of all of their ordered items
# - Tax (Look up the sales tax of your city)
# - Tip (Give the user the option to enter how much they want to tip)

# Remember! Functions are meant to be reusable, so write a function that will work when called for each person!

# -------------------------------------------- 












# -------------------------------------------- 

# Part 4:
# Let's print out a receipt for each person.

# Write a function that will take the values of each person's order and total cost and print it out in an appealing way.

# The receipt should include:
# - Cost of each item
# - Total cost for the order

# Remember! Functions are meant to be reusable, so write a function that will work when called for each person!

# -------------------------------------------- 










# -------------------------------------------- 

# Part 5: Upchallenges!

# How many of these upchallenges can you implement?

# - Make sure the user is only entering valid values. If they enter an invalid value, prompt them to re-enter. 
# - The displayed prices should only have two decimal places.
# - Display the tax and tip values
# - Implement a rewards system (stamp cards, buy one get one, etc)
